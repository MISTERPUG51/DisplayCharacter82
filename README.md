# DisplayCharacter82
Whoa! Someone actually made an assembly program for the TI-82 in 2024!

### What is it?
Display Character 82 is an assembly program for the TI-82. All it does is allow you to cycle through all 256 characters in the character set of the TI-82. This program was designed to work with the CrASH shell.
